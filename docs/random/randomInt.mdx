## Basic usage

Generates a random integer between `min` and `max`. The range is inclusive on both ends, so `randomInt(0, 1)` will return 0 or 1.

This uses `Math.random` for randomness, so it's not cryptographically secure. If you need cryptographically secure randomness, use `randomSecureInt` instead.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.random(0, 100) // => a random number between 0 and 100
```
